# dairy-entry-journal-GUI-
Hey there! 👋 This is a super simple, beginner-friendly personal diary app I built using Python’s Tkinter library. Think of it like your own digital notebook where you can type out your thoughts, save them, and read them later whenever you want.
✨ What it does:
✔️ Password protected login — only you can open your diary
✔️ Write and save diary entries — type whatever’s on your mind and save it as a text file
✔️ View saved entries — see a list of your past notes and open them to read anytime
✔️ Clean and minimal GUI — made using Tkinter, no confusing stuff
💡 Why I made this:
As a daily Journaling person, I would love to have it Digitalized. I have been journaling since 9th grade. I have always wondered, why isnt there a platform to take it to laptops/PC yet? So, once I learned GUI, I was able to make my childhood dream come true.
