# dairy-entry-journal-GUI-
Hey there! 👋 This is a super simple, beginner-friendly personal diary app I built using Python’s Tkinter library. Think of it like your own digital notebook where you can type out your thoughts, save them, and read them later whenever you want.
✨ What it does:
✔️ Password protected login — only you can open your diary
✔️ Write and save diary entries — type whatever’s on your mind and save it as a text file
✔️ View saved entries — see a list of your past notes and open them to read anytime
✔️ Clean and minimal GUI — made using Tkinter, no confusing stuff
💡 Why I made this:
I wanted a simple, easy-to-use digital diary to practice my Python GUI skills — and turns out it’s pretty useful too! No fancy databases, no logins, just you and your thoughts.
